**Technologies Used**
Frontend:
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript

**Project Overview:**
-A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage tasks and projects by representing work items as cards on a board. The board is divided into columns that represent different stages of the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). 
-Users can move tasks between columns to reflect their current status.

**Main Features**
-Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with titles and descriptions.
-Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Tasks can be moved between columns using drag-and-drop.
-Editing and Deleting Tasks: Users can edit task details or delete tasks.
-Persistent Storage: Task data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, so tasks are saved even if the page is refreshed.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, the Kanban board project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to discuss any aspects of it in more detail
